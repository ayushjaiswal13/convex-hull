# 🌟 Convex Hull Implementation using Graham's Scan 🌟

This project implements the **Graham's Scan algorithm** to compute the convex hull of a set of 2D points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points in a given set. This implementation is designed to efficiently handle and process large datasets while ensuring accuracy and optimal results.

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Efficient Convex Hull Calculation**: Uses the Graham's Scan algorithm to compute the convex hull in O(n log n) time.
- 📊 **Large Dataset Handling**: Optimized to manage and compute convex hulls for large datasets of 2D points.
- 🔍 **Robust Algorithm**: Ensures precise and accurate computation of the convex hull.

## 🔎 Algorithm Overview
Graham's Scan is a classical algorithm used to compute the convex hull for a set of 2D points. The algorithm works by:
1. 🔹 Finding the point with the lowest y-coordinate (and leftmost if ties).
2. 🔸 Sorting the remaining points based on the polar angle they form with the anchor point.
3. 🔺 Using a stack to iteratively build the convex hull by checking the orientation of triplets of points.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- 💻 **C++ Compiler**: The code is written in C++, so a working C++ compiler (like g++, clang++) is needed.
- 📦 **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilizes STL containers like `vector` and algorithms like `sort`.

## 🔧 Practical Use Cases

Convex hulls have various practical applications in fields like geographic data analysis, pathfinding in robotics, game development for collision detection, and clustering in data science, where defining boundary regions is crucial for efficiency and accuracy.
